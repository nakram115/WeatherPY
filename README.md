##What's the Weather Like?

## WeatherPy

Created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator.  Utilized [simple Python library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy), the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api), to create a representative model of weather across world cities.

Built a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
